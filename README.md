# Algorithms and Datastructures (AD)
This is a repo containing my outlines/exam notes for the course [Algorithms and Datastructures (AD)](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndaa04010u) at DIKU.

*NB: The notes are in danish.*

## Discretion
These notes are **not** meant as a replacement for reading the course material, but rather to give an insight as to what could be a good idea to include when presenting one of the subjects at the oral exam.

Some figures used in the outlines may be screenshots of figures in CLRS or the course slides, while others have been specifically drawn for this. No copyright intended.

You may use these notes at your own discretion, but beware of possible changes of the course curriculum or exam form as compared to when I attended it.


## Compiling
To compile all the .tex-files at once, run

```
$ bash compile_all_tex.sh
```

Since this repo is mainly about the pdf's, I have chosen to precompile them for convenience.

## Found a mistake?
If you find any mistakes in these notes, you are more than welcome to make a pull-request.
